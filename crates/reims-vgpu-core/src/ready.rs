//! When an admitted transaction may begin, and how a wait that will never be
//! answered is told from one that has simply not been answered yet.
//!
//! # Three kinds of prerequisite, and only one of them is ordered by arrival
//!
//! A hazard edge points backwards in ingress order by construction, so a
//! transaction's hazard prerequisites are always transactions that already
//! exist. A **stamp wait** is not like that at all: the guest may submit a
//! packet that waits for a value nothing has produced yet, and the packet that
//! will produce it may not have arrived. That is legal and ordinary, and it is
//! why the two are tracked apart — counting them together would make "waiting
//! for work that exists" and "waiting for work that does not" the same state.
//!
//! A **pipeline wait** is the third, and it is here rather than at the draw for
//! the reason [`crate::pipeline`] exists: a draw may not block, wait on a host,
//! or discover work. A transaction whose pipeline is still being built is
//! therefore not ready, and everything that does not want that pipeline is —
//! which is the whole claim, and it is only structurally true if the wait lives
//! in the readiness service beside the other two rather than in a check the
//! draw performs.
//!
//! Its terminal case is unlike the other two. A hazard is discharged by
//! completion and a stamp by publication, but a pipeline can be *refused*, and
//! a transaction waiting on a refused pipeline will never be ready. That is not
//! a stall to diagnose later: [`Scheduler::pipeline_refused`] returns those
//! transactions at once, so the caller withdraws them and names the reason
//! instead of leaving them holding their channel's head forever.
//!
//! # Nothing here blocks a thread
//!
//! Readiness is published, not waited on. A transaction becomes ready when its
//! last prerequisite is discharged, and the caller collects the ready set. No
//! method here parks, sleeps, or spins, because a scheduler that can block is a
//! scheduler that will eventually block the drain.
//!
//! # A wait nobody can answer is a diagnosis, not a timeout
//!
//! [`Scheduler::stalled`] names the transactions whose stamp waits no admitted
//! transaction will publish. That is a different statement from "this is taking
//! a while": it is derived from what has been admitted rather than from a
//! clock, so it is true the instant it becomes true and it stays true. A guest
//! waiting on a stamp nobody will write is a hang with a cause, and this is the
//! cause.
