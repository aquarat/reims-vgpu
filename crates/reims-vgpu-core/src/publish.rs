//! Ordered guest publication: when a completion stamp becomes something the
//! guest may read.
//!
//! # Completion is not publication
//!
//! Work finishing and the guest being told it finished are two events, and the
//! gap between them is the whole point of this module. A transaction's content
//! versions, event signals and fence updates become visible when its work
//! completes — out of order, as fast as the host finishes them. Its completion
//! stamp does not: a stamp is the word the guest polls to decide that
//! everything up to that point in its channel is done, so publishing it while
//! an earlier position in the same channel is still outstanding would tell the
//! guest a lie it has no way to detect.
//!
//! So each publication domain is a FIFO, and completion may release only the
//! ready positions at its head.
//!
//! # An independent domain stays free
//!
//! Head-of-line blocking within a domain is the contract. Head-of-line
//! blocking *between* domains is a bug, and the way to not have that bug is to
//! not have a structure that could express it: there is no shared queue here,
//! no global head, and no ordering between domains at all. A domain whose head
//! is stuck holds its own finished positions and nothing else's, and
//! [`Publisher::blocked`] counts exactly that so the cost is visible rather
//! than inferred.
//!
//! # A position that will never finish must leave
//!
//! A refused, cancelled or reset position is still a position, and leaving it
//! at the head would stall its domain forever. [`Publisher::withdraw`] removes
//! it and releases whatever was queued behind it — which is the only way a
//! refusal is *quiet* about ordering while being loud on the failure channel.
